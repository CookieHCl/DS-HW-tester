# DS-HW-tester
Python scripts to test the functionality of your code for the homework tasks of the Data Structure lecture(2020).

Note: a file named '.txt' was found under the '/3-StackCalculator/testset/output/'.
It was ignored in the parsing of the testsets as it did not match the input format for the project.
