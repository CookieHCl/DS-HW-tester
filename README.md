# DS-HW-tester
##Python script to run automated tests on the homework tasks of the Data Structure lecture(2020).

The default testsets are the official ones, having been downloaded from ETL, with the following exception:  

   A file named '.txt' was found under the '/3-StackCalculator/testset/output/'.

   It was ignored in the parsing of the testsets as it did not match the input format for that project.

### How to use the tester
1. Clone the repository to your environment of choice.
2. Place your compiled .class files into the /source directory.
3. Run tester.py with Python 3.
